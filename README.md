This will eventually turn into a git repository to house all the code needed to complete the projects.


Step 1:
 - Install Git: http://git-scm.com/download/win
 
Step 2:
 - Fork Repository (Upper right button)
 
 Step 3:
  - Set up a folder on your computer where you can keep a copy of this repo
  
 Step 4:
  - Open up the command prompt
    - If the folder you created in Step 3 is open on your desktop, type `cmd` where the file path is and the terminal will open
    
 Step 5:
  - type `git clone  https://github.com/marghubmirza/MirzaStock.git` and hit enter
  
 You should now have the same copy I have and can run the code as needed!
 


# Description
The **R Bootcamp** (also known as “Data Wrangling in R”) provides an overview of the fundamental concepts necessary to work within the R statistical programming language. Through a series of annotated, hands-on lessons that include practice exercises, students will learn to understand the basic principles of the R language including: 1) installing R and conducting basic operations in RStudio; 2) understanding R objects, assignment, and data types (e.g., numeric, character, logical); 4) working with different data structures (e.g., vectors, factors, and data frames); 4) using functions and packages to read and write data; 5) manipulating data; and 6) basic and intermediate plotting. No prior programming experience is necessary to benefit from this course.
