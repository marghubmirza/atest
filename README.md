This will eventually turn into a git repository to house all the code needed to complete the projects.


Step 1:
 - Install Git: http://git-scm.com/download/win
 
Step 2:
 - Fork Repository (Upper right button)
 
 Step 3:
  - Set up a folder on your computer where you can keep a copy of this repo
  
 Step 4:
  - Open up the command prompt
    - If the folder you created in Step 3 is open on your desktop, type `cmd` where the file path is and the terminal will open
    
 Step 5:
  - type `git clone https://github.com/DistrictData/uva.git` and hit enter
  
 You should now have the same copy I have and can run the code as needed!
